- Firstly, thank you for the task! :) And of course I wouldn't commit to the master in a real world :D
- The task can be understood in two ways. One way is with creating new fields on the account object, and the second way - providing a layout in LWC with checkbox and response text. I just went for the second one.
- Therefore, I don’t see a need for a trigger here, as we do a callout to the LWC and display the result there. Maybe I just don’t really get what functionality you want to achieve with a trigger.
- It’s been a while since I’ve written LWC :) I’ve left out such things as error handling and a good-looking layout that I would normally do for production.
- The StringGeneratorCallout class is of course by no means perfect. It is not really reusable except for this case. If it was a real project and I had more time, I would separate callout and logic, so we could reuse it for other cases.
- There is one more button to change the account name to the response, otherwise, I don’t see a point to make a callout and not saving it anywhere.
